"""Conversation ingest: a transcript becomes dated document nodes, losslessly.

Session ingest (`kin ingest sessions`) keeps a summary of the first 8,000
characters, and `kin add` keeps what its extractor picked out. Questions about
past conversations ask for the details those drop: an amount, a date, a name,
what the assistant recommended. Here every message is kept, whole messages are
packed into `document` nodes of at most `node_chars` characters (the cap file
ingest uses), each node carries the conversation's date as `prov_when`, and the
nodes of one conversation are linked in order so graph expansion can reach a
node's neighbours.

With an LLM configured, `digest_conversation` also reads each conversation once
(and, with `conversations.facts`, writes down its dated facts as nodes):
the user's standing instructions (how the assistant should respond from now on)
become `directive` nodes, which `kin ask` shows with every answer, and a dated
summary becomes a node linked to the conversation, for questions that span many
conversations.

A conversation file is JSON or JSON Lines; each object is
``{"id": ..., "date": ..., "messages": [{"role": ..., "content": ..., "name": ...}]}``,
optionally with ``"expires"`` (a date) or ``"retracted": true``.
