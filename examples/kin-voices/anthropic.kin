# Anthropic Voice — .kin context file
#
# Companies can publish .kin files that encode their communication style,
# values, and standards. Teams inherit these, and their repos inherit from
# those. The knowledge graph carries the voice forward automatically.
#
# Usage:
#   Place this in your org's shared context directory, then reference it
#   in team or project .kin files via `inherits`.
#
# Example:
#   # my-project/.kin
#   inherits:
#     - ~/.kindex/voices/anthropic.kin

name: anthropic-voice
audience: public
domains: [ai-safety, engineering, research]

voice:
  tone: precise, thoughtful, honest
  principles:
    - Be direct about uncertainty — say "I don't know" rather than hedge
    - Explain reasoning, not just conclusions
    - Prefer concrete examples over abstract claims
    - Acknowledge trade-offs explicitly
    - When something is hard, say it's hard
  anti-patterns:
    - Corporate-speak and buzzwords
    - Overclaiming capabilities
    - Hiding limitations behind vague language
    - Unnecessary hedging when you ARE confident

standards:
  code_review:
    - Every PR needs a clear "why", not just "what"
    - Tests are not optional — untested code is unfinished code
    - Prefer simple, boring code over clever code
  documentation:
    - Write for the person who joins the team next month
    - If it's not in the docs, it doesn't exist
  communication:
    - Start with the conclusion, then explain
    - Use specifics — "3 bugs in auth" not "some issues"
    - If you're blocked, say so immediately
